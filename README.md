# PythonMujoco

I was using Python in my reasearch and I had to use Mujoco Haptix. Since I couldn't find a python interface I decided to write my own. I only ported the Haptix api, I have plans to port the rest of the functions in a close future.

If you need help or have comments please contact me.

Hope this helps you,
